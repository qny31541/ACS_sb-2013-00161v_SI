ACS Synthetic Biology

Submitted October 2013 
Revised February 2014


Contents
--------

 * Anew.py is the new heuristic
 * A1.py implements the algorithms in Densmore et al. NAR 2010
 * comparison.py reproduces the efficacy and efficency experimental results
 * datasets.py contains the all of the test libraries except iGEM submissions
 * iGEM_submissions_dataset.py demonstrates how libraries were sampled
  * {2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012}.dnald are scraped iGEM submissions by year


Requirements
------------

Algorithms and datasets:

 * Python 2.7

Comparison and visualisation:

 * NumPy
 * Graphviz


Usage
-----

Compare efficacy and efficency of Anew and A1 on datasets:

 $ python comparison.py


Check sizes of iGEM submissions dataset:

 $ python iGEM_submissions_dataset.py
